# Project 1: Moving to a City in the US
  This project uses data from the Teleport public data API that lists stats about cities around the world.
These stats include scores for the safety, economy, commute times, and environmental wellness (among other metrics).  
  One of the group members, Taylor, is looking to move out of her current residence and wants to know the ideal place to live in the USA based on metrics that are most important to her.
Specifically, this project examines the cost of living, environmental wellness, housing costs, healthcare costs, education, and safety statistics of several cities of interest.  
  After cities of interest were placed into a dataframe, the code then generated graphs to visualize the data and make it easier for Taylor to compare and contrast each city.  
  Several charts are featured, including bar charts to compare the magnitude of certain statistics, a box plot to determine if outliers existed in a column, and regression lines.
The regression lines include the correlation coefficient of the regression line to determine the strength of the correlations.
